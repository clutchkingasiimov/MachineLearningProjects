#Binary search 
def binary_search(array, target):

	"""
	Runs a binary search across the array 
	by splitting the array from the centerpoint 
	and searching through the subsets.

	If the value of the search key is less than the
	item in the middle of the interval, narrow the 
	interval to the lower half. 

	Otherwise narrow it to upper half. 
	Iterate until the value is found or the interval is empty
