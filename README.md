# Machine Learning projects


## Titanic Survival Predictions
The titanic dataset is a classification problem in which the main goal is to classify passengers as either survived or dead. The ML models implemented in the notebook are Logistic Regression and Ensemble stacking, with extensive EDA and data preprocessing done.

## King Country Regression Analysis 
The King County dataset consists of predicting the final house price by taking in input features of various housing specifications and using them to develop a regression model to accurately forecast future house prices. The project made me use R and Python together to utilize R's power of statistical analysis and Python for its machine learning. 

## Ames Housing dataset Regression 
The Ames housing dataset is a much more complex variant of the King County dataset which consists of a lot more features of all types, ranging from categorical to numeric. With around 80 features and the predictor variable as the house price, the project included extensive data preprocessing, cleansing and included using regularization techniques in order to boost the predictive force of the models while ensuring the minimization of multicollinearity
